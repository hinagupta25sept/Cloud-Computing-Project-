# Problem Statement
The developers would want to know how the user operates the website, so that they can improve the website and make it better for the user. They also require to know which features are used the most or the least to increase the website's functionality. Apart from this if the peek hours of the website are known, then it helps the owners to enhance the availabilty. For these purposes, there is a need to develop a near-real-time web-analytics solution for the website.

# Aim of the project
To provide a platform where website owners can track and analyse the usage of their website in near-real time using Cloud services.

# Description
In this project, we have deployed an AWS architecture using various services which will provide insight into who visits the website, where they come from,how long they stay, what content they view and what all features they use. This architecture will help website owners to analyse time series data on counts of visitors, views on various pages, time spent on the website,traffic on the website, actions users take, and many more.These insights can allow owners to improvise quickly to changing conditions and unknown situations.
We have also created a dashboard that will help in better visualization of analysis results in near-real time.
